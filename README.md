## WebGL fun

This is a little WebGL-demo to get used to WebGL and revive an old scene I once made in JoGL at university.
This is mostly a playground to experiment with different features and impact on speed etc.

When watching the demo please click on the canvas to request fullscreen (or just press F11 in most browsers).

Watch live demo here: [Demo on github.io](https://faldrian.github.io/WebGLfun/)
